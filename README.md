As I walked home one day, I heard the hoarse call of a cow in pain. The animal was choking on plastic trash it had found in the riverbed. There was nothing I could do to relieve its suffering. I was forced to walk away and hear its cries fade to silence. 

NO MORE! Pollution of the Saraswati river must end!

The Saraswati river, now proven to be the modern-day Ghaggar-Hakra river, is one of the great holy rivers of India. It has prospered for tens of thousands of years. But now, human ignorance threatens its very survival! Every day, household trash and industrial waste blacken its waters.

The main source of trash? Bridges. Each second, someone on a bridge tosses their trash bag into the river. Pollution doesn’t just mar the river’s lush scenery. It destroys native habitat and endangers lives! Ingestion of plastics in water kills animals. Trash also threatens the health of people who bathe, fish, and take up residence near the river. 

Signs around the area warn of a 5000 rupee fine for polluters. However, no one implements the fine, and the wrongdoers go unpunished. 

THIS MUST STOP!

Sign my petition and demand that fencing be erected on 2 major bridges crossing the river! Also lobby for the installation of security cameras and trash cans in the vicinity.

Join me in the fight to save our holy river! Share this petition. Make your voice heard!
